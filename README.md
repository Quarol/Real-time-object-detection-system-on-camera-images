# Real time object detector using YOLOv8n model.

This is a simple project using YOLOv8n, a state-of-art model, to perform object detection task .

User can manipulate confidence threshold parameter as well choose classes to permorm detection on.

System architecture utilizes threads to parrarelize the two computationally-expensive tasks - object detection and frames retrieval.
